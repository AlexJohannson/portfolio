## Oleksandr Mekhed — Fullstack Developer Portfolio

Welcome! This is my personal portfolio, built to showcase my journey into tech, my hands-on projects, and the skills I’ve developed along the way. I’m Oleksandr Mekhed — a fullstack developer with a backend-first mindset and strong frontend execution. This portfolio is more than just code — it’s a reflection of my passion for scalable architecture, clean design, and human-centered solutions.



## About Me

I’ve transitioned into tech through rigorous self-education, formal courses, and practice. I specialize in building production-grade platforms using Django, Python, React, Next.js and modern DevOps tools.



## Skills

**Backend Development**
- Python 3.12+, Django 4+, Django REST Framework
- JWT Authentication, Celery + Redis, MySQL
- WebSocket (Channels + Daphne), DRF-YASG (Swagger), Postman

**Frontend Development**
- React, Next.js, Redux, TypeScript
- Responsive design, HTML/CSS, Figma prototyping

**DevOps & Architecture**
- Docker, Docker Compose, Poetry, Nginx
- Scalable deployments, environment configuration

**Other**
- API integrations, web scraping, automation
- UI/UX iteration, grid layouts, icon labeling



## Projects

This portfolio includes several practical projects that demonstrate my ability to build real-world solutions:

- **Frontend Developer** — HTML and CSS full-fledged project built from scratch using HTML and CSS. I designed a multi-section landing page for a Frontend Developer profile.
- **Name/Value Application** - This is a simple and responsive JavaScript-based application for managing a list of name = value pairs.
- **React + Vite (User & Recipe Dashboard - DummyJSON API)** — This is a responsive web application built with React that integrates the DummyJSON API to manage user authentication, user profiles, and recipe data.
- **Next.js (User & Recipe Dashboard - DummyJSON API)** — This is a full-featured web application built with Next.js that integrates the DummyJSON API to manage user authentication, user profiles, and recipe data.
- **AutoRia Clone — High-Load Vehicle Marketplace (Pet Project)** — AutoRia Clone is a personal backend pet-project inspired by real-world vehicle marketplaces. I built it from scratch to explore scalable backend architecture, real-time communication, and DevOps orchestration. The goal was to simulate a production-grade platform capable of handling high traffic, modular role management, and asynchronous workflows.

Each project reflects my growth, attention to detail, and commitment to clean architecture.
